After downloading or cloning the folder, run the following commands:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## pgAdmin Configuration

Inside pgAdmin:

1. Create a **new server**
2. Configure it **exactly as shown in Lecture One**

After completing these steps, your **database will be ready and available in pgAdmin**.
